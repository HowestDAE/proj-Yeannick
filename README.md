# proj-Yeannick
proj-Yeannick created by GitHub Classroom

a Dota 2 match history application created using WPF.net and using an API.

the Application contains 2 Pages :

- OverviewPage
- DetailsPage

OverviewPage shows you all the recent finished matches with some small information about the match.
you can look at matches from your local repository or from the online one.

DetailsPage contains a more specific look at the match by showing you the players of the match with their Level , KDA and gold

by using an API from a game I think this perfectly suits the Game Development course.
In multiplayer games match data is important. 
It can show you how balanced or how popular some parts of your game which might help you decided on what to change about the game
